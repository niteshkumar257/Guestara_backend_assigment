Q1) Which database you have chosen and why?

--> I have used Postgresql (SQL database) ,because as the elements such Category,Subcatergory and Items are structured data 
    and dependent with each other ,to get the integrity and consistancey in data I used the sql database and instead No-sql database
--> In sql database read operation are less expensive as compare to the Nosql database as the assigment and problem     it self requires lots of read operation as compare to the write operation


Q2) 2 things that I learned from this assignment?

  --> Global Error handling
  --> Swagger Documentation
  

Q3)What was the most difficult part of the assignment?

A ) Datbase designing is not difficult part but the most important part of the assignment ,from choosing database to   defining the Schema for category ,subcategory and Item


Q4)What you would have done differently given more time?

A ) I want to host both the database ans backend api's into the Aws RDS and EC2 with dockerizing both of them ,and also want to store the images on s3 but now I used the cloudinary to store the images ,also want to use caching (Redis) for read operation
